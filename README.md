# My i3wm config

This isn't very well put together.

`config` is the i3wm configuration file.

`config.old` is the original configuration file.

`i3status.sh` and `i3status.conf` are i3status configuration files (barebones, as of now).

`layouts.sh` is a simple bash script that reads `~/.screenlayout` and lets me select one of them quickly.

`toggletouchpad.sh` is for the touchpad gestures.
